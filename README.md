# Dotfiles

So as the name would suggest this is where I'll be keeping a copy of my dotfiles so that configuration is as easy as cloning the repo.
I'll probably also add in some kind of script to automatically configure everything as well.

## Dependencies

These are all of the dependencies and applications that need to be installed/that I use.
I'm assuming for the most part that the end user for this repo is using Arch Linux, because that's what I use (btw).
